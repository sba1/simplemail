Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to SimpleMail, an email client for your Amiga. The GUI and
the usage are very similar to YAM's (although YAM is currently much
more powerful), but it has (or should get) some features which YAM
doesn't offer. Please note this is BETA software. SimpleMail is
Open Source and released under the GNU Public License. Look at the
bottom of this file to see how to obtain the sources or get CVS access.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleMail requires OS3.0 and MUI 3.8.
It also needs some additional MUI Custom Classes:

 BetterString - http://aminet.net/dev/mui/MCC_BetterString-11.15.lha
 NList / NListtree - http://sourceforge.net/projects/nlist-classes/
 PopPlaceholder - http://aminet.net/dev/mui/MCC_Popph.lha
 TextEditor -  http://aminet.net/dev/mui/MCC_TextEditor-15.27.lha

Make sure that you always have the latest versions installed! Especially
having the latest NList classes (at least 0.96 of the package) is very
important.
