INTRODUCTION

Welcome to SimpleMail, an electronic mail ("E-mail") client for your Amiga.
The program and the general usage is very similar to YAM's, although YAM is
currently much more powerful. However, SimpleMail has (or should have in
the future) some features which YAM doesn't offer yet.

Please note this is a BETA release. This means lots of bugs are lurking
there, some of them dangerous - you have been warned.


Current features of SimpleMail:

  in groups.

- An @{" address book " LINK "AB_W" 0}, including groups and tons of data
  for each entry.

- Built-in POP3 & SMTP clients, which can check any number of different
  mail servers in one connection, preselect messages for download and
  (optionally) use SSL/TLS based encryption for added security.

- A simple IMAP client

- Unicode support

- Automatic message handling, using @{" filters " LINK "CO_F" 0}.

@NODE "INST" "Installation"

INSTALLATION

To install SimpleMail, just drag the "SimpleMail" drawer you found after
uncompressing the archive to the place you want.

No assign or further operation is necessary - you can open the drawer and
double click the SimpleMail icon to run the program.

Exception: you might have some old MUI custom classes lying around that will
be used by SimpleMail; make sure you're using the latest versions of those
mentioned under @{" Requirements " LINK REQS}.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "TUTO" "Quickstart"

QUICKSTART

This chapter is meant to be a step-by-step guide to the way SimpleMail is
configured and is mostly aimed to first time users. If you're a former YAM
user or are otherwise familiarised with email, you probably won't need to
read this at all.


1. Before we go ahead, you need this info from your Internet Service
Provider:

 - your e-mail address
 - the Internet address of your mail server (also known as "POP3" or "SMTP
   server")
 - your password, required to log in on the mail server

As an example, we'll explain how to setup a single account for an user
called "Ralf Schumacher", living in Germany. His e-mail address is
"ralf\@provider.de" and the address of his mail server is "mail.provider.de".
His password is "formula1".

2. Start SimpleMail by double clicking its icon. After a short time, the
main window should appear, containing three listings -the folder list,
the message list and a cut-down version of the address book- and a row
of buttons.

3. The program must be configured before you can do anything else. Choose
"Configuration..." from the "Settings" menu or just click the "Config"
button at the top-right corner to open the Configuration window.

4. The sheet which then appears is called "General". Here you can select
your folder directory and set the adjustment for daylight saving time.
If daylight saving time applies to you at the time of installation, turn
it on here. Leave the folder directory as it is for now. It's also very
important to tell SimpleMail about the charset your font supports. For our
example the default charset should fit.
Then select the "Accounts" page on the lefthand side listview. Now the
accounts page appears with another list into it. The contents of the list
represents all your accounts. At the start there is only one empty account.
Select it.

5. Here is where you must enter the absolutely vital information needed
for you to be able to send and receive email. Following our example, we
enter this under "User":

                    Name:           Ralf Schumacher
                    E-Mail Address: ralf\@provider.de

then this under "Receive":

                    Type:           POP3
                    Server:         mail.provider.de
                    Login:          ralf
                    Password:       formula1

and lastly, this under "Send":

                    SMTP server:    mail.provider.de

6. Some mail servers require you to download your email before letting you
to send any. If this applies to you, just tick the gadget "Log into POP3
server first".

7. Save the settings now by clicking on [Save]. SimpleMail should now have
enough data to allow you to send and receive email.

8. After saving the settings, you're back in the main window. Click the
[New] button (fifth button from the left) - the Compose Message window
will open. As a quick test, type your own address into the "To" text field
(like "ralf\@provider.de"), and then something to indicate the subject of
your message into the "Subject" text field. As you press <Return> in this
field, you're brought to the large blank area where you can type the actual
message.

You can attach a file to your message if you want. To quickly add some files
to your message, just press the "Attach" button in this window - a file
requester will appear to allow you to select the files you want. After
the selection has been done, you are presented with the current message
composition in a more verbose way - which by the way you can activate
at any time using the "Show Attachments" button.

9. Assuming you are not currently online (your TCP/IP stack is not running),
click on [Send later]. This moves the message to the "Outgoing" folder
instead of sending it immediately as [Send now] would try to do.

10. Now start your TCP/IP stack and go online. Open the "Outgoing" folder
by clicking on "Outgoing" in the folder list contained in the main window.
The message is already selected, so send it by clicking the "Send" button
at the top. The transfer status window will appear and report the progress
as SimpleMail logs in on the mail server and sends your message.

11. As you've probably noticed, the mail has vanished from the 'Outgoing'
folder, and can be found now in the "Sent" folder. The letter picture in
the list has a little stamp on it now, which means that the message has
been sent successfully.

12. When you double-click the message, the Read Message window will open.
You should be able to recognize the text written by you. The lines in
the upper part of the message have been inserted by SimpleMail and
contain data needed for mail transfer (the so-called "headers").

13. Since you've written the mail to yourself, it's time to check your
account for new mail. Close the Read Message window and then click the
"Fetch" button at the top of the main window.

14. The transfer status window you saw before opens again and you can
watch how SimpleMail downloads your mail from the mail server. Provided
that everything runs as it should, you will now be able to read your email
in the "Incoming" folder, which now shows a highlighted number "1" to let
you know that there is new mail there.

If you've made it this far without any major problem, you should now
know the basic operation of SimpleMail. Keep reading the following chapters
for further information about the single topics related to SimpleMail.

@NODE "SPAM" "Spam"
@SMARTWRAP
@{b}Introduction@{ub}@{LINE}
~~~~~~~~~~~~@{LINE}
Most people commuincating via email also receive emails with very dusky
content. It's not only that fetching those mails cost bandwidth and resulting in time
to download them, but also very much time to sort them out manually. To make
the life a little bit easier SimpleMail provides for the latter thing
some useful and quite powerful tools.


@{b}Terms@{ub}@{LINE}
~~~~~@{LINE}
SimpleMail uses some common terms describing the value of an email. Emails
which aren't desired because of there dusty contents are called @{i}Spam@{ui} mails.
Within the @{" Main Window " link "MA_W"} such mails contains a special status image.
Mails which are valualbe for you and hence you actually want to read are called @{i}Ham@{ui} mails.


@{b}Statistical Spam identification@{ub}@{LINE}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{LINE}
This kind of filtering is the center and the most powerful spam identification
feature of SimpleMail. However to work properly you have to setup it correctly.

But setting up the identifaction is not very complicated. Basically you have to tell
SimpleMail which mails are spam and which mails are ham. With help of this procedure
SimpleMail learns which kind mails you consider as spam or which as ham. For example
spam mails often contains charateristic words. SimpleMail will find out which these
are.

Once SimpleMail has gathered enough information it is now able on request to go through
the contents of new mails and hopfully will identify its spamness correctly.


@{b}Black and White Lists@{ub}@{LINE}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{LINE}
Depending of the size of an email the processing might take very long. Also you might
know some email addresses from which owner you know that they surly produces contents which you consider
as spam. On the other hand there you also have many thrusted friends of and you know that no
spam mails are sent by them.

For this purpose SimpleMail knows about the concept of black and white lists. These lists
can be manipluated by you. Usually you add known spaming email addresses to black lists.
As soon as an email you want to process is originated from such a mail adress its contents
is completly ignored. Instead the mail is marked as spam. The same counts for addresses within
the white list, except that the mails orginated from one of these addresses are never
marked as spam. Additionally SimpleMail knows also about a option that all addresses within your
address book are seen as they were in your white list.


@{b}And how can I use these functions now?@{ub}@{LINE}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{LINE}
Simliar to the "Incoming", "Outgoing" and "Sent" folder SimpleMail always presents also a "Spam"
folder. This is the folder were all mails which you consider as spam should be placed. Only mails
in this folder count really to the spam statistics. So if you want to tell SimpleMail about spam mails
you have to move these mails somehow into this folder.

The first way to do it is to move mails manually to this folder, eighter by drag and drop or by
selecting the "Move" operation from the menu or via the buttons. However as only spam mail are allowed inside this folder,
you have to mark the mails as spam before. This can be by selecting the mails and setting the
mail status to spam. SimpleMail also supports the possibility to change the status of all mails
before they are moved to the folder automatically. This option can be set within SimpleMail's
@{" Configuration " link "CO_W"} on the Spam page. The option is on by default.

The second way is to press the "Isolate" button within the @{" Main Window " link MA_W}. All mails which
are marked as spam are moved then into the spam folder.

Teaching SimpleMail about ham mails can be done via the "Folder/Classify all Mails as Ham" menu entry.
Note that selecting this entry classifies all mails within the current folder as ham (except those
already marked as spam). So you must be sure that no spam mail has been not marked as such.

Alternativly you can select the mails and use the context menu. This is also a way to revert a wrong
classified mail.

If you have classified about 500 emails for every class you can now try to issue SimpleMail to do
a spam check. This can be done with the "Spam" button within the @{" Main Window " link "MA_W"}.
Hopefully it works properly otherwise you should revert SimpleMail decision via the context menu.
After all mails are classified correctly you should press the already know "Isolate" button which moves
the spam mails into the folder where they belongs to.

To setup the black and white lists you have to go to the @{" Configuration " link "CO_W"} onto
the "Spam" page. This is also the place where you can switch on the "auto spam check" feature. That
option activated means SimpleMail now does a spam check on every new mail you have been finished to
download. All what you need to do is to press the "Isolate" button. But don't forget to check at least quickly
that SimpleMail hasn't identfied accidently a ham mail as spam mail. That's the reason that this
step has be done still manually. Although if you have setup the filter properly it is always possible.
It's always better to be safe then sorry.

In case you think there is something wrong with the spam identification you also have the possibility
to separatly reset the statistics within the very same window.

Main window - FOLDER LIST


The following four standard 'mailbox' folders are always present:

Incoming:  This mailbox holds new messages addressed to you. Whenever you
download new mail, this is where the new messages will go initially. You
can however redistribute incoming messages to other folders, as desired,
using @{" filters " LINK "CO_F" 0}.

Outgoing:  This mailbox holds the messages which you have written and which
you intend to transmit the next time you go online.

Sent:  Here you can see the messages which you have already sent. Messages
are moved to this mailbox (from "Outgoing") when they are actually
transmitted. Again, you can use @{" filters " LINK "CO_F" 0} to transfer sent messages to
other folders.

Deleted:  This mailbox contains messages marked for deletion. Usually,
messages are not actually deleted from the hard disk until you quit
SimpleMail. This allows you to recover messages deleted earlier in the
session.


Using the @{" Folder menu " LINK "MAM2" 0} you can create more folders (and folder groups)
to hold messages which you have received and/or sent, so you can arrange
your email in whatever way you like.

The folder list contains two columns: one for the name of the folder, and
another one for the total number of messages in every folder. The column
widths can be adjusted by using the mouse to drag the thin line separating
the column headings in the folder list itself.

You can rearrange the folders using the @{" Drag&Drop " LINK "Drag" 0} technique.

To see the contents of any particular folder, just click on that row
in the folder list -- the message list will then appear at the right.

Double clicking an entry in the list opens the @{" Edit folder " LINK "FO_W" 0} window,
where you can edit some properties for the selected folder.

Under the folder list there is a status bar listing the total, new and
unread messages in the currently selected folder. There is also a button
at the right side of this status bar, allowing you to switch to & from
the "alternative" view of the main window: the folder list will disappear,
and this status bar will jump to the top. Also, an additional pop-up gadget
will appear now at the right side of the status bar, allowing you to easily
select another folder and see some stats.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "MA01" "Main window - Message list"
@TOC "MA_W"

Main window - MESSAGE LIST


The message list has nine columns:

Message status:  An icon showing the @{" status " LINK "MA0S" 0} of the message (new, unread,
read, etc.)

Sender/Recipient:  Displays the e-mail address or the name of the sender
or recipient of the message, depending on the type of mailbox. If the
message was sent to several people at the same time, a little icon will
appear in front of the name, showing three tiny heads.

Subject:  Subject of the message.

Reply address:  Contents of the Reply-To: header in the message. If the
header is missing, this field will be blank.

Date:  The date and time that the message was posted, calculated according
to the local time (for you). For this to work, both you and the sender must
have set the correct @{" timezone " LINK "CO00" 0}.

Size:  Size of the message, in bytes.

Filename:  Name of the file containing this message.

POP3 Server:  The POP3 Server from this message was downloaded. It is blank
if this information is not available.

Received:  The date and time that the message has been arrived on your pop3
server. Its calculated according to the local time (for you). For this to
work, both you and the sender must have set your correct @{" timezone " LINK "CO00" 0}.


The column widths can be adjusted by using the mouse to drag the thin
lines separating the column headings in the message list itself. The order
of the columns can also be modified by dragging the column headers with the
mouse.

You can also turn on/off individual columns using the pop-up menu that will
appear if you keep the right mouse button pressed while the pointer is
over the headings.

A little arrow in one of the column headings shows how the messages are
sorted. One click on a column heading causes the messages to be sorted
according to  this criteria. A second click on the same heading reverses
the order of sorting (Z->A instead of A->Z). To set the second sort key,
keep the <Shift> key pressed while clicking on the column heading. Please
note the From/To fields are always used as a sort criteria; this part of
SimpleMail still needs some work. :o)

A double click on an entry in the list opens a @{" Read Message window " LINK "RE_W" 0} and
displays the corresponding message. You can use the mouse to move messages
to another folder. Click on an entry and drag up/down (holding the left
mouse button) to mark a block of messages. Then click and @{" drag " LINK "Drag" 0} the
marked block to the left, into the folder list, and drop it onto the chosen
folder.

EDIT FOLDER

Apart from the four mailbox folders "Incoming", "Outgoing", "Sent" and
"Deleted", you can create any number of user-defined folders. These folders
are useful e.g. to archive received and/or sent mail, or to administrate
mailing lists.


Name

The name of the folder will appear in the folder listing in the main
window.

    Example:  SimpleMail


Path

This is the path in which the messages of the actual folder will be saved.
Usually this is a subdirectory in the basic "/.folders" directory, but you
can specify any other place, like another hard disk partition for example.

    Example:  SimpleMail_ml


Type

Here you choose if the folder is for received and/or sent mail. This
influences the column titles and whose address is displayed in the message
list. If you select "mailing list", the message list for this folder will
be threaded by default.


Default to

Here you can enter an email address which will be used by default as the
main recipient of your email whenever you start writing a new mail while
this is the current folder. This makes sense especially with folders
containing email coming from a certain mailing list.


Signature

Here you can select a signature which will be used by default
whenever you start writing a new mail while this is the current folder.
Selecting <Default> will use the signature of the default from account.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO00" "Configuration - General"

Configuration - GENERAL (Essential information needed for SimpleMail to work)


The time and date displayed by SimpleMail in the message list is always
converted to your local time. This guarantees correct sorting of messages
from all over the world sent out from different time zones. The time zone
is part of the message's date and specifies the difference between local
time and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

Usually SimpleMail will get the time zone from your Locale settings.
Should the time zone have a special value (e.g. a difference of half
an hour) it can be defined in the environment variable ENV:TZ.

  Examples : GMT+1 (for Germany)
             GMT   (for the U.K.)
             GMT-5 (for U.S. EST e.g.  New York City)


[ ] Add adjustment for daylight saving time

This option is to be activated during daylight saving time. By doing so,
one hour will be added to the time zone value.


Folder directory

Here you can select the directory where your folders will be stored by
default when they are created.


Charset used to display text

Here you should select the charset in which the fonts are designed you use
to display the text. Default is IS0-8859-1 with Euro, which are the fonts
of the euro update. E.g. Polish Amiga Users should use AmigaPL.


Folder to display at startup

Here you can select the folder which should be displayed when Simplemail is
started. If no folder is selected the "Incoming" will be shown.


AppIcon Show

You can select the appearance from the AppIcon.
   Always     ->  Always show the AppIcon.
   Iconified  ->  Only show the AppIcon when SimpleMail is iconified.
   Never      ->  Never show the AppIcon

The normal iconified Icon of SimpleMail can be turned on/off in the MUI-Prefs
of Simplemail in the "System" group.


AppIcon Label

SimpleMail will use this text to be shown under the AppIcon. Click on the
pop-up button to select a variable from the list.


AppIcon Position

workbench.library < V44 (< OS3.5):
  The position of the AppIcon can be set with the ToolTypes APPICON_POSX
  and APPICON_POSY.
workbench.library >= V44 (>= OS3.5):
  Use the (Un)Snapshot menuitems from the Workbench->Icon menu. Of course
  you can also use the ToolTypes if you want but the Snapshot function of
  the workbench does have the higher priority if you have used both.
  It's also possible to exit Simplemail by invoke the "Delete" item of
  the Icons menu.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO01" "Configuration - Accounts"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - ACCOUNTS  (Information needed for internet mail-transfer)


Here you can add new accounts both for sending and receiving email. There
is currently no limit for the number of accounts you can create.

Note that every account can be for the same user on a different server, or
a different user on the same server. Either way, you can check for new mail
with a single mouse-click by clicking "Fetch" in the main window. Click on
[Add new account] to insert the data required for a new e-mail account.
With [Remove account] you can (obviously) delete accounts.


---- User ----------------------------------------------------------------

Name

You should enter your real name here.


E-Mail Address

Guess what you should enter here! :)


Reply Address

Usually this field should remain empty. The default Reply-To address is
your e-mail address. ONLY if you want to use a different address you
should enter that here.


Signature

If you have defined different @{" signatures " LINK "CO08"} you can select
the default signature for this account. The signature will than be used if
this account is selected in the Compose Message window. Selecting <Default>
will use the first signature of the list.


---- Receive -------------------------------------------------------------

POP3 Server

The Internet address of your system's mail server. This server which
normally is a computer of your ISP (Internet Service Provider) must be
capable of working with the POP3 protocol.

  Example:  mail.provider.uk


Port

Since the port number of the POP3 service is 110 in most cases, this is
the default value. If yours is different, enter that number here.

  Example:  110


Login

Insert the User ID for the POP3 server here. In most cases this will be
identical to the username in your e-mail address. However there are
exceptions, so check the instructions from your ISP. (SimpleMail then
constructs the full account name in the form <login>\@<server>.)

  Example:  sebauer


Password

The password which is asked by your mail server. This password is possibly
but not necessarily identical to the password you use to log into your ISP
(e.g. using PPP). If your computer is used by other people or for any other
reason saving your password in the configuration file without any encryption
at all is an issue, you might want to leave this field empty and select "Ask"
instead - this way SimpleMail will ask you for your password when it is
needed, instead of saving it on disk permanently.

  Example:  codingismylife


[ ] Active

Turn this option on to have the selected POP3 server checked for new
mail every time you push the "Fetch" button. If you don't want this e-mail
account to be checked automatically when using this button, switch off
this option and instead use the menu item "Folder/Check single account"
in the main window.


[ ] Delete mails

If this option is activated, new mail will be deleted after downloading
it from the mail server. The messages will be deleted only after they have
been successfully saved to your computer. If the POP3 account is used by
several people, or if you'd like to access your account at a later time
from another computer, turn this option off.


[ ] Avoid duplicates

If you decide not to have SimpleMail delete the mail on the server after
downloading, it will be downloaded again the next time SimpleMail gets your
mail, so every message will appear twice in your mail folder. To prevent
this, turn this option on - as long as this option is activated, SimpleMail
will keep track of all your downloaded messages in the '.uidl.<account>'
file, using special commands of the POP3 server to avoid downloading the
same message twice. If the POP3 server supports these UIDL commands, this
check will be done rather quickly. If the server doesn't support these
commands, SimpleMail will try to read the Message-ID field using the TOP
command instead of the UIDL commands. In case the mail server doesn't
support any of these commands, this option shall be turned off.


[ ] Secure

If this option is activated, the whole communication process between
SimpleMail and your mail server will happen under SSL encryption, or more
exactly under the TLS protocol as described in RFC #2595, using port 995
instead of the usual 110. In a nutshell, this adds extra security to prevent
the common eavesdropping and hijacking attacks which POP is subject to.

The "with STLS" gadget enables the use of the POP3 STARTTLS extension, adding
another layer of security to the process. This will in turn use the standard
port 110.

If your POP3 server doesn't support any of this or for some reason SimpleMail
cannot establish a communication with an acceptable level of security, you'll
receive an error message while checking for new mail.

Also, note this requires AmiSSL to work.


---- Send ----------------------------------------------------------------

SMTP Server

The Internet address of the system you're sending your mail to. This
server which usually is a computer of your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
must be capable of handling the SMTP protocol.

  Example:  smtp.provider.de


Port

Since the port number of the SMTP service is 25 in most cases, this is the
default value. If yours is different, enter that number here.


[ ] Use SMTP AUTH

Enable this if you're using a server which requires authentication (ask
your ISP if in doubt). You will need an additional login and password in
this case, to be entered in the Login/Password fields above.


[ ] Secure

Enable this to use a secure SSL/TLS connection with the SMTP server.
In this case, SimpleMail will use the SMTP STARTTLS extension as
described in RFC #2487 to request an authenticated communication
with the SMTP server, trying to protect the communication from
the typical man-in-the-middle attack coming from any system routing
the communication. This does not mean that the entire SMTP chain
has been made private though - any other SMTP server in the chain
carrying your email to the final recipient is still subject to attacks.

If your SMTP server does not support this, you'll receive an error
message while trying to send email - in that case, switch this option
off.

Again, this requires AmiSSL to work.


[ ] Log into POP3 server first

Some Internet Service Providers require you to log into your POP3 server
before you are allowed to send email, as this step requires you to identify
yourself and thus helps keeping SMTP abusers out. If your ISP requires this,
tick this box.


[ ] Use IP as domain

Enable this if you keep getting requesters like "X-Authentification-Error:
pD957C509.dip.t-dialin.net claimed to be t-online.de" when trying to send
your email -- this will force SimpleMail to use your current IP instead of
the domain part of your email address while talking to your mail server.

Configuration - RECEIVE MAIL  (Setup for downloading mail)


---- Preselection --------------------------------------------------------

After establishing a link with the POP3 server, you might be interested
in using a @{" preselection window " LINK "TR_W" 0} showing a list of all new mail in the
POP3 mailbox. This allows you to decide whether to download, delete or
leave a message on the server, according to its size, topic or sender. For
pre-selection to work properly, the server must support the TOP command
(which most of them do).

 disabled:           pre-selection is never used
 only sizes:         all messages will be displayed but only their sizes
                     will be shown. The advantage of this method is that
                     it is pretty fast.
 enabled:            every message will be displayed in pre-selection


Size limit

If pre-selection is activated, messages which exceed the value given here
in size will be highlighted. This way you avoid downloading messages with
huge attachments. If you want all messages to be listed, select "All
messages".


---- Automatic operation -------------------------------------------------

Check for new mail every [xx] minutes

Here you can specify a time interval after which SimpleMail will
automatically recheck your mail server for new mail. To deactivate
this option, just enter zero.

  Example:  15 minutes


---- New mails -----------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Sound

Here you can select a sound file that will be played any time you get
new email. You can use any sound format supported by the datatypes
currently in use. Click the pop-up gadget to select a file, and the
PLAY symbol to test the sound.

---- Editor --------------------------------------------------------------

Word wrap

While you are writing a new message, the message will be formatted to make
sure that no line has more characters than the value specified here. You
can also choose if SimpleMail should insert line breaks as you type or if
this should be postponed until you send the message.

  Example:  76

By default, wordwrapping is disabled.


---- Replying ------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Wrap before quoting

If this option is activated, SimpleMail will wordwrap the message you are
replying to, according to the wordwrap setting entered above.


[ ] Strip signature before quoting

If this option is enabled, SimpleMail will search for the standard "-- "
(two dashes and a space) signature separator in the message you are
replying to, stripping all the text coming next. Since not quoting
signatures is obviously a good idea anyway, usually this option should
be left activated.


[ ] Cite empty lines

Usually SimpleMail won't quote empty lines when replying to a message.
If for some reason you don't like this, just activate this option.

when an action delete or move*) is performed on the last mail of the
current folder.

fixed-width font, if that's what you really want. :)


Fixed Font

If you select one, this font will be used to display the message body in
the Read Message window. Fixed-width fonts are usually better suited for
this task, as proportional fonts will break about any fancy ASCII signature
or table you will read. :)


---- Colours -------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can select the palette colours for the various items composing the
Read Message window: background, plain text, quoted text, old quoted text
(two generations old instead of one) and text which is part of a link,

wheel.


[ ] Wordwrap plain text

If this option is activated, very long lines going beyond the right border
of the Read Message window will be wordwrapped. This is irrelevant for
headers, which are always wordwrapped if needed.


[ ] Underline links

Tick this option to make links (e.g. e-mail and WWW addresses) to be
displayed underlined. This also includes links appearing in the message
headers.


[ ] Use graphical smilies

If this option is activated, those ever-popular ASCII smilies like ":)",

Configuration - PHRASES  (Welcome/Close phrases used when writing email)


With SimpleMail you can set a welcome, intro or close text for your messages
according to the recipient of your message, including the texts used when
replying or forwarding a message. This way, you can not only customize
SimpleMail to e.g. use generic german texts when writing to any #?.de
domain, but also to automagically use some funny text when posting to a
certain mailing list, use a more serious tone if you're replying to
your boss, or pretend to be the perfect lover when corresponding with your
significative other. Keep readin'! ;^D


Use on addresses which contain

Enter here the pattern that the TO: field of your outgoing message should
be compared to. If the contents of the TO: field of your message match
this pattern, the appropriate set of phrases will be used, depending on
whether you're writing, replying or forwarding a message.

If this field remains empty, this set of phrases will be used by default
is case no other set apply.

  Example:  #?.(de|ch|at) (Addresses of countries with German mother tongue)


---- Write ---------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome

SimpleMail will insert this text at the beginning of every new message you
write (except for answers and forwarded messages). You can define a line
break by inserting '\\n'.

  Example:  Hi!\\n


Welcome with address

If you use the addressbook to start a new message, SimpleMail will use this
welcome text instead. Click on the pop-up button to select a variable from
the list.

  Example:  Hello %r,\\n


Close

This text is inserted at the end of every new message you write, just
before the signature separator. You can insert a line break with '\\n'.

  Example:  bye,\\nSebastian Bauer


---- Reply ---------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome, Intro, Close

Whenever you reply to a message, SimpleMail will automatically insert these
in your reply.

  Example:

    [Welcome] Hello %f,\\n
    [Intro]   On %d, you wrote:\\n
    [Close]   Regards


---- Forward -------------------------------------------------------------

Initial (NYI)

This text will be added at the beginning of the original text of any
message you forward whenever this set of phrases apply. Click on the
pop-up button to select from a list of variables which can be inserted
(for example %r stands for the name of the recipient, %s stands for the
subject, etc.). When the text is inserted into the message, SimpleMail
replaces the variables with their values, which are taken from the
forwarded message.

  Example:  *** Forwarded message, originally by %n on %d: ***\\n


Finish (NYI)

This text will be inserted at the end of a forwarded message (but before
the close phrase). Click on the pop-up button to select a variable from

signature for private mail, another one for business, another one for a
certain mailing list, etcetera).


Use signatures

Tick this box if you really want to use signatures.


Use taglines

Tick this box is you want SimpleMail to automatically add a random
tagline to every email you write - just insert a %t in the signature
and it will be replaced by a random tagline taken from the /.taglines
file when you compose a mail.


[Add new signature]

Click here to define a new signature and then enter a name and the text
for it.


[Remove signature]

Obviously, this gadget allows you to remove a signature already defined.


If the use of signatures is activated, a cycle button will appear in the
Compose Message window to let you select which one you would like to use in
the message that is being written.

Configuration - SPAM  (Definition of Spam handling)

For detailed information see @{" Spam " LINK "SPAM"}.


---- General spam settings -----------------------------------------------

[ ] Mark mails as spam before moved to the spam folder

The spam folder allowes only mails marked as spam to be moved into.  This
option will set the status of all mails to spam before they are moved
to the spam folder. The option is on by default.


[ ] Check new mails for spam content

If this option is on all new mails will be checked automatically.


---- White list ----------------------------------------------------------

Mails originated from one of these addresses are never marked as spam.

[ ] Also all addresses within the addressbook

This option handle all addresses within your address book as if they were
in white list.


---- Black list ----------------------------------------------------------

Here you can add known spaming email addresses. As soon as an email is
originated from such a mail address its contents is completly ignored and
the mail is marked as spam.


---- Statistics ----------------------------------------------------------

Number of mails classified as ham

This is the number of mails you have classified as ham so far.

[Reset statistics...]

This will reset the classified mails to zero.  After reseting the ham
statistics the spam filter won't work reliable until you have classified
some mails as ham.


Number of mails classified as spam

This is the number of mails you have classified as spam so far.

[Reset statistics...]

This will reset the classified mails to zero.  After reseting the spam

@NODE "CO_F" "Editing filters"

EDITING YOUR FILTERS


The purpose of a mail filter is to process mail according to some criteria
defined by the user. Whenever a mail matches a specified pattern, it can
trigger certain actions.

Currently SimpleMail's filters can only move emails to another folder.
There isn't any fixed limit to the number of filters your can create,
though.

The list on the left shows the names of the filters defined so far.
Click on a name to bring up its details on the right, on [New] to create
a new filter, or use [Remove] to delete one of them. Please note that
filters are executed in top-to-bottom order.
You can change the order with the [Move up] or [Move down] button.


[Add new rule] allows you to define a new rule, selecting what part of
the e-mail should be scanned for a given search pattern. You can use
as many rules as you want, and they accumulate in a "If all these rules
are true for this email, then do this" fashion.

To start with, you can select a header you want to be searched for a
given pattern. You can choose either select "Sender" (to look in the
"FROM:" field) or "Subject". (If you want to check a different header,
select "Header" instead and then type the header that should be scanned,
without any trailing colon.) Then, you must enter the search pattern
you want to use.

Alternatively, you can also enter a rule that will turn true if the email
has attachments, or is matching a given status (read, forwarded, etc.).

You can define how the search pattern is interpreted with three checkmarks:
   Substring       - The string must only be contained in the field
   Case sensitive  - The search is case sensitive
   Pattern         - The string is an AmigaDOS Pattern and patternmatching
                     will be performed.

If the "Substring" and the "Pattern" checkmarks are set the whole pattern
will be surrounded with "#?" by SimpleMail itself. Still, the search pattern
may contain AmigaDOS wildcards such as ?, #?, (a|b) or [abc].

Please note that the search pattern [RED]#? will filter all messages
beginning with  R, E or D if the "Pattern" checkmark is set.

To filter email coming from a mailing list (for example, a mailing list
with [mailinglistname] in the subject), you'd better not use the "Pattern"
checkmark or have the filter compare the "Reply-To" field with the address
of the mailing list, provided the mailing list sets this header correctly.

Special AmigaDOS patternmatching chars are: ? # | ~ ( ) [ ] % '

If you don't set the "Substring" and "Pattern" checkmarks the field must
exactly match the string you typed in (case [in]sensitive depending on the
"Case sensitive" checkmark).


  Examples:

   Sender      contains                sebauer
               Substring [x]  Case sensitive [ ]  Pattern [ ]

   Will match: Sebatian Bauer <sebauer\@example.com>
               franz.klausebauerling\@example.com
               nobody\@strassebauer.example.com


   Subject     contains                simplemail-usr
               Substring [x]  Case sensitive [ ]  Pattern [ ]

   Will match: Re: [simplemail-usr] This is a test
               Do you know the simplemail-usr mailinglist?


   Header      Reply-To       matches       plemail-(usr|dev)
               Substring [x]  Case sensitive [ ]  Pattern [x]

   Will match: plemail-usr\@example.com
               plemail-developer\@example.com


   Status is   Replied

   Will match: well, every mail with that status


[Apply now]

Applies this filter immediately to the contents of the currently selected
folder. This way you can see if your newly created filter works like it
should before saving your settings.


[ ] Apply on request

If this option is activated, the filtering process will be started by
clicking on the [Filter] button in the main window. This way you can also
process old messages which do not necessarily have to be in the Incoming
folder.


[ ] Apply to new mails

Activate this option to have all new mail processed by this filter.
Processing will be initiated automatically after receiving new mail.


[ ] Apply to sent mails

Activate this option to have all sent mail processed by this filter.
Processing will be initiated automatically after sending mail.


[ ] Move to Folder

Here you can instruct SimpleMail to move any email matching the above
rules to another folder. Select the folder with the pop-up button at
the right.

You can click and drag the column dividers to change their size, or the
headers to reposition them.

Double click on an entry to see or edit the information in the
@{" edit address " LINK "EA_W" 0} window.

An entry must contain at least the real name and the email address.
The point of the Alias is to save typing; you can put a short nickname,
or initials, into the "To" field of an email message and let SimpleMail
to look in your addressbook for a likely candidate. For this to work,
however, the alias obviously has to be unique for that entry.

Individual entries can be arranged into groups, which are like
subdirectories, used to keep the address book clearly arranged.
Use @{" drag & drop " LINK "Drag" 0} to move an entry from one group into another.

---- Personal -----------------------------------------------------

Alias  (applies to both person or group)

An  'Alias' is a convenient short name that identifies the address
book entry unambiguously. Its function is to save typing - you can
start to type the alias into the TO: field of a message, and SimpleMail
fills in the details when sending the message.

  Example:  Seb


Real Name

The person's first name and surname.

  Example:  Sebastian Bauer


Description  (applies to both person or group)

Any comment you'd like to enter to describe the current entry.

SimpleMail at the SimpleMail homepage. SimpleMail can access this data
bank automatically; all you need to do is to input the name and/or
the e-mail address, connect to the Internet and click the floppy disk
button. SimpleMail starts by getting a list of available photos and
searching it for the named person. If found, any information missing
from the address book entry (currently, only name and e-mail address)
is made good and the picture downloaded and saved in the gallery. 
If you want to add your picture to the collection, please visit
http:\//simplemail.sourceforge.net/index.php?body=gallery and enter

This window will appear when you choose to write a new message or answer
or forward an existing message. There isn't any fixed limit to the number
of Compose Message windows you can open simultaneously, besides your ability
to discern what is what under all that clutter. :)

Above the large @{" text editor " LINK "EDIT" 0} field there are at least three header
fields and a toolbar.


From

This field is automatically filled with your name and email address. You
can use the pop-up button to select another account, in case you have
defined several of them in the configuration.


To

Insert here the main recipient you wish to send this message to. You can
use names or aliases from the address book or even full e-mail addresses
in case the recipient does not exist in the address book. If you wish to
enter several recipients, you shall separate them by inserting commas.
To insert an address book entry, just drag that entry from the address
book listview over the main window and drop it over this field (you could
also open the full-view address book window and drag&drop entries from
there, but why should you bother? :). Alternatively, you can also open
the address book window, select and entry and then select the [To:] button,
but remember this will spawn a new Compose Message window!

If SimpleMail cannot find a name or alias you've inserted manually into
this field, the screen will flash as soon as you press the <Return>. You
can change an alias to an e-mail address manually by clicking on the [<]
button to the right.

  Example:  jdoe, boss\@work.whyme.com


Copies To

Insert here the secondary recipient(s) you wish to send this message to.
They will also get a copy of the current message.
The "B" button will unhide the "Blind  Copies To" input field (see below).


Blind Copies To

Insert here the recipient(s) you wish to send a "Bild Carbon Copy" of
the message. The addresses of these recipient(s) will not be revealed
to other recipients of the message.


Subject

What the mail is all about. As the mail is answered there will be a "Re:"
inserted in front of the original subject, whereas if an email is being
forwarded, a "(fwd)" will be added to the subject.


The toolbar contains the following gadgets:

Copy

Places a copy of the marked text on the clipboard.


Cut

Cuts the marked text and saves it to the clipboard.


Paste

Inserts the text currently in the Clipboard at the current cursor position.


Undo

Undoes the last change made in the editor


Redo

Restores the change just undone with [Undo].


Attach

Opens a file requester to let you select some file or files to attach
to the message.


Show Attachments

Forces the Compose Message window to be more verbose about the internal
structure of the message, showing a listview with the MIME type that
SimpleMail has selected for your attachments, as well as other info and
additional buttons. *Please note* this is still experimental, and the
MIME type used for attachments is always "application/octet-stream".


Encrypt

Push this button if you want this message to be PGP encrypted. When you try
to send this email, SimpleMail will list the PGP keys in your keyring to
let you select the key that should be used.


Importance

Here you can choose the importance of a mail (low, normal or high).


Also, if you have defined two or more signatures in the configuration
and the signature usage is activated, an additional pop-up gadget will
appear to let you select the signature you want to use with this message.


At the bottom of the window you will see a row with four gadgets:


Send now

Prepares the message for sending, copies it to the Outgoing folder and
tries to send the mail immediately. For this option to work correctly
there must be a TCP/IP stack already running and online.


Send later

Prepares the message for sending and copies it to the Outgoing folder.
Use this button when you're working offline.


Hold

The message will be prepared as described in [Send later] and copied to
the Outgoing folder, but will be held back and NOT sent. Use this button
for unfinished messages (e.g. if you'd like to make some additions to the
email at a later time and you don't want it to be sent by mistake).


Cancel

Click here in case you've changed your mind. Beware, any information
introduced so far in the window will be lost!

Message headers

The amount of information displayed in the header list for the
selected message is set in the @{" configuration " LINK "CO04" 0}. If you want to
copy some of the lines to the clipboard, click and drag with the
mouse to highlight the lines -- the copy action is automatic and the
highlighting disappears. You can also click on email addresses appearing
here to automatically open a new Compose Message window with the selected
address already filled in as recipient.


Message body

The largest part of the window shows the message body. Only text is shown
here; if the message contains several parts (e.g. some text with a sound
sample attached), some icons will appear at the bottom of the window to
let you browse among them at your leasure.

Navigation within the message is usually done with the Cursor up/down keys.
You can also use Shift-Up/Down to jump up/down one page at a time. To copy
part of the message to the clipboard, click and drag with the mouse to
highlight the text. The copy action is automatic and the highlighting
disappears. If you click on an e-mail address, a new Compose Message
window opens and the address is automatically copied into the TO:
header. A double click on a URL, be it either http:\// or ftp:\//, calls
openurl.library (if present) to start your favourite browser and go to
this address.

Lastly, you can also use a mouse wheel to navigate the Read Message window.


Icons representing attachments

If the message being read contains attachments, the bottom part of the Read
window will be occupied by icons representing those. Provided you have OS3.9
installed and DefIcons is running, double clicking an icon will trigger a
certain action, for instance launch UnArc to uncompress an LhA archive.

MAIL TRANSFERS

When fetching or sending email, SimpleMail opens a tranfer window which
allows you to have some control over the process.

If preselection is enabled, SimpleMail displays a list of the messages
available for download. Messages which exceed the pre-set maximum
size will be listed. Two explanatory status symbols may appear next
to the message -- a little trashcan means that the message will be
deleted from the server, whilst the floppy disk icon indicates that
the message will be downloaded. There are therefore the following
possibilities:

  Diskette  Trashcan   Action
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   yes        yes      The message will be downloaded and then deleted
                       from the server.
   yes        no       The message is downloaded, but not deleted.
   no         no       The message remains in the server, and is not
                       downloaded.
   no         yes      The message is deleted immediately! The preferred
                       action for unsolicited commercial email.


Meaning of the buttons:

Ignore

Clears both the diskette and trashcan icons for all selected messages,
i.e. no action is done on them.


Download

Sets the diskette icon and clears the trashcan icon for all selected
messages -> download, but leave on server.


Delete

Clears the diskette icon and sets the trashcan icon for all selected
messages -> do not download, but delete from server!


Download & Delete

Sets both the diskette and trashcan icons for all selected messages ->
download and then delete from server.


Start

The selection stage ends and the actual mail transfer begins.


Abort

The mail transfer is terminated immediately.


[ ] Ignore not listed mails

If this gadget is activated, all the messages not listed above will be
left in the server and won't be downloaded.


In the two lower status lines you can see how many bytes and how many
messages have been transferred so far, and at what rate.

SimpleMail supports a couple of startup options which can be used
from the Shell:


MESSAGE=messagefile

Opens the given message file on startup.


MAILTO=address

Creates a new message for the specified recipient on startup. You
can enter an alias or the real name of a person that can be found
in your address book, and let SimpleMail to fill the details for you.


SUBJECT=subject

Sets the subject for the new message.


ATTACHMENT=filename

Adds an attachment to the new message. This parameter can
be specified multiple times.


  Examples:

    SimpleMail MAILTO mail\@sebastianbauer.info SUBJECT "SimpleMail is cool!"
    SimpleMail MAILTO "Hynek Schlawack" SUBJECT "A love letter for you :)"
    SimpleMail MAILTO "Sebastian Bauer, Hynek Schlawack" SUBJECT Wonderful!
    SimpleMail MAILTO "Sebastian Bauer, Hynek Schlawack" SUBJECT Wonderful!
    SimpleMail MAILTO  mail\@sebastianbauer.info SUBJECT Icons ATTACHMENT DH0:Disk.info ATTACHMENT DH1:Disk.info

DEBUG=debuglevel

Sets the level of SimpleMail debug logging. If set to 0 (which is the default)
no logging messages are written.


DEBUGOUT=file

Specifies the file in which the logging is written to. If not specified, uses
serial output. 

DEBUGMODULES=modules

Specifies which modules generate logging output.



PROFILEDIR=directory

Specifies the root directory, in which all user related data is stored.


IMAGEDIR=directory

Specfies the directory, from which the images are loaded.

AREXX INTERFACE


SimpleMail sports an ARexx interface supporting a growing number of
@{" commands " LINK "REX2" 0} which can be called through the ARexx port "SIMPLEMAIL.1".
With the help of ARexx scripts you can, for instance, let it do things
automatically.

Explanation for the syntax templates of the ARexx commands:

  /A   The parameter is compulsory
  /K   The parameter must be preceeded by the keyword
  /N   Numerical argument or result
  /M   Argument or result is a list of zero or more elements


Be careful when passing arguments containing spaces. For instance,

  subj = 'Just testing'
  MAILWRITE MAILTO ralf\@provider.de SUBJECT subj

won't work, as there is a space in the variable. Better use this instead:

  MAILWRITE MAILTO ralf\@provider.de SUBJECT "'subj'"


Please note that because of the internal use of the ReadArgs() function,
the ARexx Host requires to escape certain special characters like a newline
(0x0a) or escape character (0x1b) if you want to have it included in your
final string or otherwise it is stripped by the ReadArgs() function.

This means that you have to use the following escape sequences in your
provided strings:

*n substitutes to 0x0a
*E substitutes to 0x1b
** substitutes to *
*" substitutes to "

For example the following command would write a string to a texteditor
containing a newline:

'REQUEST BODY "TEXT Hello Joe,*n I would like to meet you." "_Ok"'


Here are some escape sequences that can be used with most MUI text classes:

 *Eu    -> underline
 *Eb    -> bold
 *Ei    -> italic
 *En    -> normal text
 *E<n>  -> <n> being a number from 2 to 9,
           change the pen color for the text

These ones must be at the beginning of a string, or just after a *n :

 *Ec    -> center text
 *Er    -> justify right
 *El    -> justify left

     in front; the default gadget is activated when pressing the
     <Return> key.

     Styles can also be used.  See the main @{" ARexx " link "AREX"} page
     for more info.

     Please respect the Amiga User Interface Style Guide when creating
     requesters.  For instance, the rightmost gadget will be triggered
     by the <Esc> key, and should always offer a safe way out.

FAQ


---- Project Administration ----------------------------------------------


- Why are you writing a completely new mailer instead of just taking part
  on the YAM development, as YAM is under GPL? 

Because when we started developing SimpleMail, YAM wasn't under GPL and no
one knew if it ever would be. As we both are students of computer sciences
we decided to write our own mailer to gain some experience, and that's the
reason why we are still developing it. Another reason is that it would
probably be more work to rewrite YAM than to write our own mailer. And
last but not least, it's fun to code and to create something new and own.


- Will SimpleMail be as powerful as YAM? 

Yes, SimpleMail will have all the functions that YAM has, but less bugs
and many new features you have missed all this time.


- I don't like MUI, will you make a ReAction/ClassAct version?

I think nobody thinks that MUI is perfect but there is a very big variety
of public MUI classes that are vital for SimpleMail. However, much like
SimpleMail is portable concerning platforms, it is also portable concerning
the GUI, so there is a possibility that as SimpleMail reaches a more mature
status (no alpha/beta anymore) we provide also a version based on other
GUI engines. No promises, though. We hope that maybe one of you ReAction
fans could do it when the time comes?


- Will you include news support? (NNTP) 

Rather not, as we think that it is better to build two separate programs,
because adding news support would be too inconvenient for users who don't
want it. Wait for SimpleNews instead. ;) 


- Will you make a version for the AmigaDE? 

Yes, we hope so. 


- Will there be a port for Windows/MacOS/QNX/Linux/... ?

We think that the source code of SimpleMail is quite portable, so it
should be no problem to get it ported to other platforms. However, we
cannot do everything, so once SimpleMail leaves the alpha/beta stages
behind, feel free to contact us if you want to port it to your favourite
platform.


- Where can I download the sources?

They are available on request from the @{" Authors " LINK INFO}.



---- Everyday use --------------------------------------------------------


- How can I snapshot the position and size of windows?

Start the MUI settings interface by selecting "Settings/MUI...", then select
the "Windows" section and make sure the third of the little system gadget
buttons is activated. After saving the settings, every window will have
an additional system gadget in the upper right corner -- one click
on this gadget will snapshot the current size and position of the window
for future sessions.


- What does "NYI" mean? I find this here and there through the guide...

Not Yet Implemented. This abbreviature is used to note something that
still doesn't work as it should, or not at all.


- How can I mark a mail as "Important"?

NYI :)


- Can I use PGP to sign/encrypt messages?

You can encrypt messages with PGP 2.6.x, but you won't be able to edit
the message once it gets queued to be sent. This problem will be addressed
very soon.


- Can I use SimpleMail as an external mailer from my browser?

Yes. On @{" Startup options " LINK "OPTI" 0} you can see the most simple way to do
it, and here's also how to do it using OpenURL (these instructions courtesy
of Stefan Martens):

 1. Open the OpenURL prefs program, usually installed in your "Prefs"
    directory.

 2. Click the "Mailers" tab, then click the [Add...] button to add a
    new mailer to the configuration.

 3. In the new window, enter the following:

      Name:             SimpleMail
      Path:             (SimpleMail path, like "Work:SimpleMail/SimpleMail")
      ARexx port:       SIMPLEMAIL.1

      Show/Uniconify:   SHOW
      Screen to front:  SCREENTOFRONT
      Write Mail:       MAILWRITE MAILTO '%a' SUBJECT '%s'

 4. Click [Ok] and save the configuration.


- What about importing my old email from YAM?

You can do it easily, too, starting from SimpleMail 0.14. Take a look at the
@{" Scripts menu " LINK "MAM5" 0} and the supplied ImportMails.smrx script.


- How about implementing this and this and...?

(David) Please bear with the developers. SimpleMail is only a hobby, and
intelligent as they are, they're very busy students, also working in other
projects :-) Currently SimpleMail is being developed at a slow but also
continuous pace. Please be patient. :-)

In the meantime, feel free to enter feature requests and report bugs at
the SourceForge site. See the @{" Authors " LINK "INFO"} chapter for more info.


- The style of this guide seems familiar...

Well, I (David) used YAM.guide as <ahem> inspiration. Why should I
reinvent something so well done? :) Feel free to send suggestions to
david\@saug.org


- This FAQ does not resolve my problem.

Well, as long as your problem is related to SimpleMail ;) feel free to
join the support mailing list to get feedback from the authors as well
as from other SimpleMail users. See the @{" Authors " LINK "INFO"} chapter for
more information.

constructed by joining the date the file was saved and a running
number for that day. The mail status is saved as a suffix. For every
folder there exists an index which contains the headers of every message
in the directory. There is also a configuration file which holds the
settings for that particular folder.

The .taglines file contains your favourite collection of taglines, separated
by the mandatory "%%" string.

@NODE "SimpleHTML" "SimpleHTML"

SimpleHTML is a tool by Sebastian Bauer that allows you to browse HTML
documents offline. SimpleHTML supports only a little subset of the HTML
tags, but it is powerful enough to browse most HTML documentation, for
example.

The SimpleHTML engine is already built-in in SimpleMail to allow you to
easily read HTML mail, i.e. you don't need to go and install SimpleHTML
separately. Still, if you want to give SimpleHTML a try (which is probably
a good idea anyway :), the latest version should be always available in
Sebastian's homepage:

              http:\//www.sebastianbauer.info/
